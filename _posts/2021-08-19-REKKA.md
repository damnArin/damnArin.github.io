1. 
ভালোঃ BGM, Production design, আলি ফজল এর অভিনয় 
খারাপঃ পরিচালনা, সংলাপ, চিত্রনাট্য 
কয়েকটা খুব ভালো surreal দৃশ্য (প্রায় নায়ক এর কথা মনে করিয়ে দেবে এমন) শুরু করেও শেষ না করা মোটামুটি অমার্জনীয় অপরাধ।

পুনশ্চ: hands off of me হয়, hands off me না।

2.
(spoilers ahead)
An utter load of crap! 
1. Vasan Bala coming to do a cameo (Is Srijit influencing everyone?)
2. Vik's Tee Shirt saying Skorse da (A Scorsese ref? Like that?) and Bhuter Raja 
3. Didi wearing a 'song of the little road' (সেটা কি বস্তু জানতে গুগল করুন)  
3. Vik reproducing 'That's just your opinion man' with a 'dude' in front of it (Really? Homage to Coen-brothers?)
4. Whole didi motif is copied (inspired) from Hirak Raja, Didi sitting on Bhuter Raja star 
5. And that whole line on I'm your Pratidwandi, Nayak, Agantuk, Kapurush - Mahapurush - হচ্ছেটা কী ভাই ওটা? 
6. even the barmat is bhuter raja
7. And, in the end, an OSHO reference (Oregon) 
Vasan Bala is a good director who has produced nice movies in the past (Mard ko dard nahi hota, Raman Raghav). What was so wrong this time?
I wouldn't have any problem had this series been named Bala, or Mukherjee, or even Chaubey. Please stop wasting the audience's time folks. Being remembered through history has no shortcut.
HOWEVER, and this however is big, the second part sort of makes sense (after the DIdi character starts on screen) and this part looks more Bala-esque (yeah, audience also knows how to use the word Kafkaesque). It almost feels like he became free after a first-half being directed by someone else (a Mukherjee?).
