What do I do every day of the week? I wake up, go to office couple of hours later, curse cafeteria food there, come back. In the weekends, I sometimes watch movies and maybe have a drink or two. The whole staying afloat one day at a time, is in short - boring. And that's why what we all wish for, is a miracle. 
Well, that's what this movie is about. It's about miracles, and miraculous moments. Hollywood, just like Mumbai, is famous as City of Dreams. It sells dreams to people who don't live many. And all the people who come there, look for that one solitary magical moment, which will change their lives forever. 
And not surprisingly, that's true for everyone in the city. Be it the mighty "Rick-Fucking-Dalton" (Leonardo DiCaprio), or the newbie Sharon (Margot Robbie). And that is precisely the reason she exists in the movie, to be compared with Rick. 
And just like you need to see a lot of darkness to fathom what a lamp can do to it, you need to hella bore the audience to make sure s/he understands what a miracle actually means. And that's where despite the cinematic similar moments of cowboy-esque kicking asses, Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are different - one's sinking ship meets a miracle shore, other's does not.
No, this is not a Tarantino-esque movie. Tarantino is definitely identified by hordes of audience as the violence guy. His movies must show a lot of killing, some in very gruesome ways. That way, he lives up to himself when Rick "torched" people around. But that's not why it's not different. It's different because he seemed halfway here and halfway there. It seemed, as if, the director, could not do what exactly he felt like, and was vehemently opposed by himself in certain cases. I, for one, did not have any problem with the pace of the movie, but it suddenly came up with a narration to keep up with the pace. I felt cheated. 
Brad Pitt is spectacular, while LeoDCap is like: "I try", simply because he did not get many chances to show his color, except for the shooting scenes. Al Pacino was there probably to do justice to the whole - you do small roles at the end of your career - theme. Editing, screenplay etc. are not really out of the ordinary so don't need much mention.
Of course this is not his best work, not even probably one of the bests. But did he pass his message to me? He sure as hell did.
