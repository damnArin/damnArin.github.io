Every story, every good story has to define its universe. Inside that universe, there will be certain rules. Those rules - will be followed, and adhered To. Apart from this basic trait, a good story also needs a good teller. A good clap needs good hands, and a good story needs its teller.
This story starts around its teller. Movies about movies are less, almost rare in number. And in the story of this movie, the set rules are followed. As obvious from the trailer, the movie takes shameless inspiration from that of Aladdin. It's about a djin who finds himself confined in a lamp, bottle, whatever. But only that much.

Unlike Aladdin's, where the djin is a mere tool to get material possessions, and play tricks, we peep into his mind this time. And, more importantly, his emotions. It explores a lot around the definition of wish, and the subtleties of wishing and granting them. Can you fulfill a wish that's not been asked yet? Or can you fulfill anything that is not asked for? (Apparently, Apple does and the whole topic of customer experience is banking on the assumption that you can)

And also, a bit on the definition of life as well, if you lost all wishes, or don't have any in the first place, despite the fight with Indian attitude of winning over desires, are you at all living?

And then both love and wish, and wish of love intertwined together. To quote: "the moment I ask for love, you lose the ability to grant it, for love can't be asked for". It also asks the question we so casually ask over and over again and makes it a point, us humans being too difficult to love: is being loved too much to ask for?

The moment of truth for me in the movie was when the narrator becomes a giver. The moment you start giving and grant others' wishes you become the djin itself, probably the highest form of love.

However, I would disagree with the attitude towards technology - that despite its presence, inherent human nature is constant, and would argue that technology did change our behavior a lot and humans are different than what they were before the advent of tech. 

Also, I did not like the way it ended. Loved the movie, but not its ending. 

Overall, I'm glad this movie was made, and I'd definitely recommend the audience invest their time in this one. 

PS: The IMDb rating is 6.9. I have no clue why that's the case.
