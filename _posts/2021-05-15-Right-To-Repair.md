title: "Right to Repair"

I don't exactly remember if I was talking about this earlier, but I feel Right to Repair movement is crucial and it bears the same weight as the FOSS movement did or does. 
So, for the uninitiated, companies like Apple would not only prevent customers to repair their devices themselves (this is already known), they'll also ask the parts manufacturer to sell the parts to none but them only, which makes the repairing task impossible. 
Now imagine for a moment, there is no Python language, there is no R, and there is no Unix. And all the analytics (or other development) you do, either has to be done in MS Excel (which is an extremely fine piece of software for sure but has its limitations), or has to be performed via a proprietary (and crap) tool called SAS. 
That's the kind of world we'd be heading to if we indulge the no-repair behaviour of companies. This is essentially putting shackles to knowledge and history taught us that the world did not progress by clipping the wings of knowledge, but by spreading them. 
I am a follower of both Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) and Louis Rossmann (Louis Rossmann) for long and it's nice to see both Marques and Louis teaming up and speaking up on this issue. Also it's great that other tech YouTubers like Zack Nelson (JerryRigEverything) and Linus Sebastian (Linus Tech Tips) also came up and supported the cause.
