The Irishman is undoubtedly a great work. Simply because it’s not really boring even with that huge a length. The star cast is well utilised,  the editing is good. The Scorsese signatures are all over the place. Which makes me think the other option: Was it a little too fast? Could the director have used a little more length and elaborated it a little more? maybe a little bit build up would have been nice. I don’t have much to complain but would like to hear what others say. 
I would also like to mention the editing, having watched 3 movies in recent times where editing has set the tone of the movie and classified them as horrible (Joker), good (Once upon a time in Hollywood), great (Irishman). 
Lastly, thanks MAMI for letting Bombay people watch great movies practically free of cost (₹500 with XYZ cashback when you book the passes, where a typical movie ticket costs north of ₹250 on weekends in the same theatres). But mob management is something which we really need you guys to be much better at.
