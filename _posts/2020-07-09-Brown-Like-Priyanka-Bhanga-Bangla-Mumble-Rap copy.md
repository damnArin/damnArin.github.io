Year 1953. A young man from Calcutta, aged about 35 years, sings a song in Bombay to be used as a playback song in a Hindi movie. Playback singing was introduced about twenty years back (Bhagya Chakra, Bengali, 1935) and this song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDr9g_x2nYk&ab_channel=ShemarooFilmiGaane) will be used in a movie called Boot Polish. The young man is Manna Dey.  
Almost 70 years down the line, after the ages of vinyl, cassettes, audio CDs, mp3s and iTunes downloads respectively, while both the cities changed their names, another young man, albeit insignificant, listened to it via a music streaming website. Boy! How lucky he was!
